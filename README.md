- Hey! I’m Zaid — a developer who enjoys crafting full-stack applications with clean logic, smooth UIs, and just the right amount of caffeine ☕.

Here’s what I’ve worked with:

🟨 JavaScript / TypeScript – for both frontend magic and backend logic
⚛️ React.js + Vite – building fast, interactive web apps
🖥️ Electron.js – bringing web experiences to the desktop
🧩 Chrome Extension Development (Manifest V3) – customizing the browser experience
🎨 Plain CSS – styled from the ground up when frameworks aren’t needed
🧱 UI Libraries like Material UI, shadcn/ui, and more – for rapid, elegant UI building
🌐 Node.js + Express.js – backend development with RESTful APIs
🗃️ MongoDB & PostgreSQL – flexible with both NoSQL and SQL databases
🖌️ Figma – designing clean, user-friendly interfaces before diving into code

- Beyond code, I’m passionate about drawing, character design, and exploring the world of game development 🎮. I love blending creativity with tech — whether it’s in designing user interfaces or imagining entire fantasy worlds.

- I enjoy writing clean, maintainable code and learning new things along the way. Whether it's frontend, backend, or somewhere in between — I'm always excited to build.

Thanks for stopping by!
